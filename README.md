# RPG_Creator
RPG_Creator is a web application designed to create and manage role-playing games from a narrative perspective.

## Concept
The app offers an interface to create, launch, or join a game:

* Join: Players can choose a game from a lobby. Once inside, the Game Master (GM) can include them in the session.

* Launch: When a user launches a game, they are automatically assigned as the Game Master. They can either run a fully improvised game or load a preset scenario previously created in the "Create" mode.

* Create: This section allows the Game Master to prepare characters, environments, NPCs, scenarios, and more.

The goal is to provide Game Masters with a clean, intuitive interface to manage their stories, characters, and game elements. Players can connect from their phones to view their stats (and optionally, NPC stats if allowed by the GM). The GM can also share special items, maps, room images, and other visual elements during the game.

## About the project
This is my first web application project. It is primarily a learning experience and might not be a perfect example of web development best practices, but itâ€™s an exciting start!

----------------------------------------------

## Technical details
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

* Backend: Python (with possibly PHP)

* Database: NoSQL

The application will be containerized with Docker, making it easy to run without any manual installation. Docker also lays the foundation for potential future improvements and deployment on a production server.
